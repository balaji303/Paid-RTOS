-> API Based RTOS

-> Not a Product

-> RTOSs can be build using API's from CMSIS RTOS

-> Thus a middleware can be developed from it

-> You will still have access to vendor specific API's as well

-> This is used in OS Emulation layer of existing RTOS

-> the CMSIS RTOS is just an API defined by ARM and not an actual real time operating system.

Keil has offered a variant of their RTX RTOS which is compatible with the CMSIS RTOS API. So you can use a firmware written against the CMSIS RTOS API directly on the Keil RTX.
