-> 3ed Genereation kernel

-> Inter-thread communications

-> Thread Synchronization

-> Resourse Management

-> uC-OS - II is also so popular

-> ROMable means able to place the RTOS code in the application itself

-> Unlimited number of tasks

-> Unlimited number of priority

-> Unlimited number of kernel object

-> Kernel aware debugging


Common files found in FreeRTOS are as follows
	-> queue.c
	-> timers.c
	-> event_group.c
	-> croutine.c
	-> FreeRTOSConfig.h

FreeRTOS variable Names
	-> 'c' int8_t (char)
	-> 's' int16_t (short)
	-> 'l' int32_t (long)
	-> 'b' BaseType_t

	Example 
		uint8_t : uc
		pointer to char : pc

Task Management
	-> void TaskFunction(void *pvParameter); 
	->  argument: pointer to void

Task creation

	-> BaseType_t xTaskCreate( TaskFunction_t pvTaskCode,
const char * const pcName,
uint16_t usStackDepth,
void *pvParameters,
UBaseType_t uxPriority,
TaskHandle_t *pxCreatedTask
);


-> Lower the numberr higher the priority of the Task
